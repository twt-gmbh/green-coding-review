# optimize solution based on FLOPS

# The time complexity of the solution mainly depends on sorting the two arrays. Sorting is typically a time-consuming operation, and the sorting operations dominate the overall time complexity.

# The optimized solution provided earlier has a time complexity of O(N log N), where N is the maximum of the lengths of the two arrays `g` and `s`. This is due to the sorting step.

# If you're looking to optimize for FLOPS (floating-point operations per second), it's important to note that sorting involves comparison-based operations that are not directly related to floating-point operations. Therefore, the main optimization would still be focused on reducing the number of comparisons or using more efficient comparison-based algorithms.

# However, if you're interested in optimizing FLOPS for other parts of the algorithm, you can consider:

# 1. **Looping Operations**: In the loop where you're iterating through the sorted arrays, the number of iterations is proportional to the length of the arrays, which would be O(N). This part of the algorithm mainly involves index increments and comparisons, which are not particularly FLOP-intensive.

# 2. **Arithmetic Operations**: If there are any arithmetic operations within the loop (such as addition, multiplication, etc.), you can try to minimize unnecessary operations. However, in most cases, these operations are relatively fast and not the main bottleneck.

# 3. **Using Built-in Functions**: Python's built-in functions and libraries are generally well-optimized for performance. Using these functions often results in better FLOPS optimization compared to writing custom arithmetic operations.

# Remember that FLOPS optimization is often more relevant for numerical computing, simulations, and certain mathematical operations. For tasks involving sorting, comparisons, and array indexing, the primary concern is generally the algorithm's overall efficiency in terms of comparisons and memory access patterns rather than FLOPS.

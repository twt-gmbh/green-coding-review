# Q: Give me a FLOPS optimized solution for this problem.
# You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. 
# You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, 
# and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.
# We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. 
# If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1
# class Solution:
#     def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:

# optimize solution based on FLOPS

#FLOPS (Floating Point Operations Per Second) optimization is generally more relevant in performance-critical scientific computing or high-performance computing scenarios involving complex mathematical computations. In the context of the given problem (searching/inserting into a sorted array), FLOPS optimization isn't directly applicable, as the algorithm doesn't involve significant floating-point computations.

# The algorithm's performance is primarily influenced by memory accesses and branching operations (if-else conditions). Since the binary search algorithm is already well-optimized for minimizing these operations, further FLOPS optimization wouldn't have a substantial impact.

# If you're looking for general optimizations to minimize computational complexity or improve performance, you might want to consider multithreading or parallelism in cases where multiple search operations are performed simultaneously. However, this would require a specific context where multiple search/insert operations are being performed concurrently.

# In the context of the provided problem and algorithm, FLOPS optimization is not a suitable approach for improving performance. The binary search algorithm's logarithmic complexity is already quite efficient for this specific task.
